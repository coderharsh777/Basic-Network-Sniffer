# Basic-Network-Sniffer


This repository contains a simple network sniffer implemented in [Programming Language, e.g., Python] using [Networking Library, e.g., Scapy]. It captures network packets and displays basic information such as source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols.

**Features:**

* **Packet Capture:** Captures network packets from a specified interface.
* **Protocol Filtering:** (Optional) Allows filtering packets based on protocols like TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.
* **Basic Packet Information:** Displays source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocol.
* **Interface Selection:** Allows the user to select the network interface to sniff.
* **Simple Output:** Prints packet information to the console.

**Usage:**

1.  **Installation:**
    * Install the required libraries: `[Installation instructions, e.g., pip install scapy]`
2.  **Running the Sniffer:**
    * git clone this file file :- using in '[git clone https://github.com/coderharsh777/Basic-Network-Sniffer]'
    * Execute the script: `[Command to run, e.g., sudo python sniffer.py]`
    * (Optional) Specify the interface and filter: `[Example command with options]`
3.  **Viewing Captured Packets:**
    * The captured packet information will be displayed in the console.

**Dependencies:**

* [Networking Library, e.g., Scapy]
* [Programming Language, e.g., Python]
